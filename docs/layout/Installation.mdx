## Installation

MUI Treasury no longer provides npm packages. Instead, you can run the CLI to pull the source code to your project and adjust to your needs.

```sh
npx mui-treasury@latest clone layout-core
```

By default, the source code will be cloned to `src/mui-treasury/layout-core` unless you specify a `dir` in `<root-directory>/mui-treasury.config.js` file.
