# Overall Configuration

```tsx
<Root
  scheme={{
    header: HeaderSetupParams,
    topHeader: HeaderSetupParams,
    subheader: HeaderSetupParams,
    leftEdgeSidebar: EdgeSidebarSetupParams,
    rightEdgeSidebar: EdgeSidebarSetupParams,
    leftInsetSidebar: InsetSidebarSetupParams,
    rightInsetSidebar: InsetSidebarSetupParams,
  }}
></Root>
```

`SetupParams` has similar structure.

```ts
{
  config: Responsive<ComponentConfig>
  hidden?: boolean | Breakpoint[];
}
```

### `Responsive`

responsive is an object which has breakpoint as key. Valid breakpoints can be one of these `xs | sm | md | lg | xl`. Check [material-ui documentation](https://material-ui.com/customization/breakpoints/#breakpoints) for the viewport size of each breakpoint.

Example

```ts
{
  xs: { ... };
  sm: { ... };
  lg: { ... };
}
```

### `hidden`

By setting `hidden: true`, the component will have `display: none`, this is useful for hiding in specific screen (ex, hiding EdgeSidebar in homepage).

Or set as an array like `hidden: ['xs', 'xl']`, the component will have `display: none` ONLY in `xs` and `xl` viewport.

Check [material-ui documentation](https://material-ui.com/customization/breakpoints/#breakpoints) for the viewport size of each breakpoint.
