# Command line interface

## Init

Initialize a configuration file, `mui-treasury.config.js` in the current directory.

```bash
npx mui-treasury@latest init
```

or create the `mui-treasury.config.js` manually at the root of your project:

```js
// mui-treasury.config.js
export default {
  dir: "src/mui-treasury", // your project's directory to clone the blocks to.
  template: "typescript", // only `typescript` is supported at the moment.
  storybook: false, // if `true`, the storybook file for the block will be cloned as well.
  branch: "main", // the branch to clone from. `main` branch is the stable channel.
};
```

## Clone

Clone a block and save to the target directory.

```bash
npx mui-treasury@latest clone [blocks...]
```

Pick a block from the sidebar. For example, if you want to clone `Card/News/Maldives`, the block id will be `card-news-maldives`.

Then run the clone command with:

```bash
npx mui-treasury@latest clone card-news-maldives
```

To clone multiple blocks at the same time, try:

```bash
npx mui-treasury@latest clone card-news-maldives card-travel-spa
```

> ðŸ’¡ You can only clone 3-levels deep, for example, the `card-travel-spa` will clone the [CardTravelSpa](/story/card-travel-spa--spa) and [CardTravelSpaCover](/story/card-travel-spa--spa-cover) into the same folder.

To override the default config or `mui-treasury.config.js`, pass any of the options below:

```bash
Options:
  -d, --dir          the project directory to clone the blocks to. (default: "src/mui-treasury")
  --storybook        included the block storybook. (default: false)
  -b, --branch       the github branch of mui-treasury to use. (default: "main")
  -h, --help         display help for command
```
