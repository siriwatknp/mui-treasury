# Layout V6

**Required**: Material UI v5 or beyond

A group of components that come with a set of predefined layout schemes to help you build modern web layouts instantly.

## What's new in v6

> ðŸ’¡ only compatible with `@mui/material@v5` or beyond. If you are using `v4, please follow the [migration to v5](https://mui.com/material-ui/migration/migration-v4/) first.

- Written from scratch using modern CSS features like [CSS Grid layout](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_grid_layout), [Container Queries](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_containment/Container_queries), [`:has()` selector](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:has), [CSS Variables](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties), etc.
- Remove the use of React context and move most of the logic to CSS.
- Support Pigment CSS integration which lets you remove the `use client` directive.
- The codebase size reduced from **356KB** (v5) to **70KB** (v6).
- Support `sx` prop for customizing the style of components.
- One component per DOM node to make it easier to style.

## Why this project exists

I created this because

- It took me a lot of time to initialize dashboard layout when I have
  new projects or ideas to prove and Iâ€™m sure that a lot of you are the same as me.
- Sometimes it is hard to refactor because the structure is so poor
  because someone isnâ€™t deeply understand what he/she was doing, as a
  result, rewrite the whole layout which affect other parts of project and you heard your colleague shout "WTF"
  (it actually happened, at least in my experience).
- Because we need to be fast to let others continue our work, we
  frequently write poor and a lot of code. However, we say we donâ€™t
  have time to fix them. Eventually, spend all day paying technical
  debts.

## Objectives

It must be easy enough to use, however still be able to adjust to be compatible
with real word examples and usages. More importantly, it need to follow [Material specs](https://material.io/design/components/navigation-drawer.html#)
since we are 100% based on Material UI. Last but not least, responsive is a must.
