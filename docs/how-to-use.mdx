# How to use

If you haven't started a Material UI project yet, you can use one of the following playground:

There are 2 ways to use the blocks:

## 1. Copy and paste

This is a quick way to try out a block.

1. Go to the blocks that you want to clone. For example, [Card Galaxy](/story/card-galaxy--galaxy).
2. Click "See code" on the toolbar at the top of the page

3. Copy the code and paste it into your project.

If you need to use a lot of blocks at once, I recommend using the [command line](#2-clone-blocks-through-cli) instead.

## 2. Clone blocks through CLI

You should have a working Material UI project before you start, or use one of these playgrounds:

1. Go to the blocks that you want to **clone**. For example, [Card Galaxy](/story/card-galaxy--galaxy).
2. Click "Add" on the toolbar at the top of the page

   Then, you will see the block appear in the selection (other blocks that are the dependencies of the block will be added as well).

3. Click "Copy" to copy the command line to your clipboard.

4. Go to your project, open the terminal at the root directory, and paste the command line.
   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/db480cf0-5e29-441f-8f72-ad125b10e8f3)

   After running the command, you will see the block(s) in the `src/mui-treasury` folder.

5. Import the block to a page. It's that simple!

For more details about the command line interface, check out the [CLI documentation](/docs/command-line--docs).
