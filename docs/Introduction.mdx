# Welcome to MUI Treasury

MUI Treasury is a collection of [Material UI](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/) blocks. It is a place to discover and explore the best MUI UI has to offer.

üó£Ô∏è This is **not** a component library. Instead, we offer a [CLI](/docs/cli--docs) tool to let you clone the blocks you want into your own project. You can tweak and customize them to your heart's content. The best part? you own the code!.

## What is a block?

A block is a self-contained component that can be used in any MUI UI application. A block can be as simple as a button or as complex as an entire page.

## How to use a block?

See the [How to use](/docs/how-to-use--docs) section for more details.

## How to contribute?

If you want to request a block or create one, see the [contributing guide](https://github.com/siriwatknp/mui-treasury/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).
