# Core Concept

There are 3 parts that synchronize with each other. configuration, logic and components.

### Data flow

In order to build layout, you need to use layout api to setup configuration of your layout.
Think of it as a set of commands to control the behavior and effect of the components. Technically, config is just
a plain object of key-value pairs. let see some example.

Pass the config to `Root` component to let it spread the commands. `Root` is react context provider behind the scene (no magic here)
The config that `Root` receive will be encapsulated for communicating with other components.

```jsx
import { getStandardScheme, Root } from "path/to/layout-core-v5";

const standardScheme = getStandardScheme();

const App = () => {
  return <Root scheme={standardScheme}></Root>;
};
```

Finally, place components inside `Root` to let them get the commands and display based on each responsibility of each component.
ex. `EdgeSidebar` will stay on the edge of the browser, left or right depends on the configuration. On the other hand, `InsetSidebar` is designed to display inside the container.

```jsx
import {
  Content,
  EdgeSidebar,
  Footer,
  getStandardScheme,
  Header,
  Root,
} from "path/to/layout-core-v5";

const standardScheme = getStandardScheme();

const App = () => {
  return (
    <Root scheme={standardScheme}>
      <Header />
      <EdgeSidebar />
      <Content />
      <Footer />
    </Root>
  );
};
```
