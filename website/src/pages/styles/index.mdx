The way to use Mui-treasury is to think like composing legos. There are just 2 pieces,
component and style. Both can be simple or complex depend on shape and feature.

First select the main lego ([component](/components)) then the other lego (style) need to
be compatible with the component otherwise they won't fit together and the result is not what you expected.

### Which style is compatible?

You will see on your left that we categorize into 2 sections.

**_1. Material-UI base component_** : this works right away with Material-UI v4.x component. All you need to do is

import { ThemeProvider, createMuiTheme } from '@material-ui/core/styles';
import GithubButtonStyle from 'docs/styles/button/github/index.js';

<ThemeProvider theme={createMuiTheme()}>
  <SimpleShowcase>
    <GithubButtonStyle />
  </SimpleShowcase>
</ThemeProvider>

`embed:styles/button/github/GithubBtn.js`

> use...Styles is the result of official `makeStyles` Api. [Read more about `makeStyles` Api](https://material-ui.com/styles/api/#makestyles-styles-options-hook)

**_2. Custom components_** : These styles can be applied to `Community Custom` and `Complex Composition` component.
the styles is compatible with the component if the name matches.

For example, `useBlogTextInfoContentStyles` is compatible with `TextInfoContent` component.

import BlogTextInfoContentStyle from 'docs/styles/textInfoContent/blog/index.js';

<SimpleShowcase>
    <BlogTextInfoContentStyle />
</SimpleShowcase>

`embed:styles/textInfoContent/blog/BlogTextInfoContentStyle.js`

> That's all you need to know about how to use mui-treasury. Happy styling!
