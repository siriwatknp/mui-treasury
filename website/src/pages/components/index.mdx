This page shows how to maximize the benefit of Material-UI Treasury. Please read to the end of the page if this is the
first time you have seen it.

For `components` tab, it is divided into 3 section (as you can see it in the panel on your left side).

### Material-UI Extended

These are components that are extended from Material-UI directly, aim to showcase in a more practical way we use in real life.

For example, [Birthday TextField](/components/text-field/birthday)

import Birthday from '@mui-treasury/components/textField/birthday';

<SimpleShowcase>
    <Inline>
        <Birthday label="Date of birth">
            <Birthday.Day
                placeholder={'DD'}
                name={'birthday.day'}
                nextFocus={'birthday.month'}
            />
            <Birthday.Separator />
            <Birthday.Month
                placeholder={'MM'}
                name={'birthday.month'}
                nextFocus={'birthday.year'}
            />
            <Birthday.Separator />
            <Birthday.Year placeholder={'YYYY'} name={'birthday.year'} />
        </Birthday>
    </Inline>
</SimpleShowcase>

This component use official [`InputBase`](https://material-ui.com/api/input-base/#inputbase-api) as a main ingredient,
then compose with some react hook logic and turn it to a powerful form input. (Mostly, there are tests covered)

```
yarn add @mui-treasury/components
// in react component
import BirthdayTextField from "@mui-treasury/components/textField/birthday"
```

<br />

### Community Custom

For this category, the main ingredient is the official styling solution plus developer's creativity. Mostly, they are
inspiration from mockup or visual design that we want to turn them into life. Some material-ui can be included but the
majority are native html elements.

For example, [TextInfo CardContent](/components/card-content/text-info)

import TextInfoContent from '@mui-treasury/components/content/textInfo';

<SimpleShowcase>
    <Inline>
        <TextInfoContent
          overline={'March 20, 2019'}
          heading={'Nature Around Us'}
          body={
            'We are going to learn different kinds of species in nature that live together to form amazing environment.'
          }
        />
    </Inline>
</SimpleShowcase>

It is composed of 3 `Typography`s with specific responsibility (`overline` `heading` & `body`). Then we create a bunch of
different styles that follow the same api (think of them like Lego that should match in order to be compatible).

See all [TextInfoContent styles](/styles/card-content/text-info)

```js
yarn add @mui-treasury/components
// in react component
import TextInfoContent from "@mui-treasury/components/content/textInfo"
```

<br />

### Complex Composition

Finally, whatever components that you think it is complex (compose of other category's component) lay on this category.
This group is hard to have different styles because the CSS Api is quite different from each other. The most obvious component
would be `Card` that contains other component like `CardHeader`, `CardContent`, `CardFooter`, `CardActions` and any custom
component. Give the component a new name is better than trying to use the same CSS Api. For example, `BlogCard`, `PlaneTicketCard`
...

import PlaneTicketCardDemo from "docs/components/card/planeTicket";

<SimpleShowcase bgcolor="#003399">
    <PlaneTicketCardDemo />
</SimpleShowcase>

[See the code](/components/card#Plane%20Ticket)

Another important point is this category is **not** available in `@mui-treasury/components` since they are too specific and hard
to be customized again. But if you like, you can copy the code in the website and then use it in your project.
