# Material-UI Treasury [![PRs Welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/PRs-welcome-green.svg)](https://github.com/siriwatknp/mui-treasury-next/pulls)

Imagine a place with millions of real-world, ready-to-use, and themable components that you can copy & paste or even install to your project. I believe that it will help boosting many projects that want to prove their ideas and make their 1st prototype to make tomorrow better than today.
## Curious? checkout [Website](https://mui-treasury.com)

I am very excited about this project because I know that there is a lot of developers who are struggling at building ui and waiting for something like this to come true. It will take a lot of time for me alone to reach thousand components. So if you want to do something great and fun, please read our [contribution section](#Contribution)

## Roadmap
#### End of 2019
- Reach 100 components
- Release `@mui-treasury/layout` version 2 (before is [`mui-layout`](https://github.com/siriwatknp/mui-layout)) 

#### 2020 (1st quarter)
- Reach 200 components
- Release `@mui-treasury/formik` an integration between material-ui & formik to help building form without tears.

#### 2020 (2nd quarter)
- Reach 300 components
- Introducing application demo (example of real-world app that combine existing components in mui-treasury)
