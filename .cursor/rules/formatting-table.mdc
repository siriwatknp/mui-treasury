## Formatting rules - This is about how you should format your responses.

# Be aware that the cursor chat you are in cant render markdown correctly.
# IMPORTANT: Tables need to be rendered in plain text and not markdown

Exmaple rendering of a table:

When rendering tables, do not use markdown table syntax or plain text alone. Instead, place the entire table inside a code/text block (using triple backticks). This ensures the table formatting is preserved and readable in the chat interface.
Example:

+----+------------+-----------+
| ID | Name       | Role      |
+----+------------+-----------+
| 1  | Alice      | Admin     |
| 2  | Bob        | User      |
| 3  | Charlie    | Moderator |
